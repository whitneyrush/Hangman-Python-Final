# Hangman-Python-Final
Hangman Game for LIS4930 Python Final
I have created a hangman game that showcases the use of time, while and if else loops, and character functions. The hangman game script is a straightforward way to showcase python's capabilities in an interactive way. The game primarily uses while loops to authorize the user to guess characters until word is guessed or until all 10 attempts are used. If guessed correctly or incorrectly, a response will be prompted accordingly.
